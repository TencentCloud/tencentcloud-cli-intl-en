For more information, please see the [corresponding document](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/2838?from_cn_redirect=1).\n\n- Mode description\n  This API supports two recording modes:\n  1. Scheduled recording mode **(default mode)**.\n    The start time and end time need to be passed in, according to which the recording task will start and end automatically. Before the set end time expires (provided that `StopLiveRecord` is not called to terminate the task prematurely), the recording task is valid and will be started even after the push is interrupted and restarted multiple times.\n  2. Real-time video recording mode.\n    The start time passed in will be ignored, and recording will be started immediately after the recording task is created. The recording duration can be up to 30 minutes. If the end time passed in is more than 30 minutes after the current time, it will be counted as 30 minutes. Real-time video recording is mainly used for recording highlight scenes, and you are recommended to keep the duration within 5 minutes.\n\n- Precautions\n  1. The API call timeout period should be set to more than 3 seconds; otherwise, retries and calls by different start/end time values may result in repeated recording tasks and thus incur additional recording fees.\n  2. Subject to the audio and video file formats (FLV/MP4/HLS), the video codec of H.264 and audio codec of AAC are supported.\n  3. In order to avoid malicious or unintended frequent API requests, the maximum number of tasks that can be created in scheduled recording mode is limited: up to 4,000 tasks can be created per day (excluding deleted ones), and up to 400 ones can run concurrently. If you need a higher upper limit, please submit a ticket for application.\n  4. This calling method does not support recording streams outside Mainland China for the time being.",
