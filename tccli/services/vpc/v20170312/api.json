It can be the ID of a security group to be modified, or the ID of another security group in the same project. All private IPs of all CVMs under the security group will be covered. If this field is used, the policy will automatically change according to the CVM associated with the group ID while being used to match network messages. You don't need to change it manually.\n* `Port`: Enter a single port number (such as `80`), or a port range (such as `8000-8010`). `Port` is only applicable when `Protocol` is `TCP` or `UDP`. If `Protocol` is not `TCP` or `UDP`, `Protocol` and `Port` cannot be both specified. \n* `Action`: Values can be `ACCEPT` or `DROP`.\n* `CidrBlock`, `Ipv6CidrBlock`, `SecurityGroupId`, and `AddressTemplate` are exclusive to one another. \"Protocol + Port\" and `ServiceTemplate` are mutually exclusive.\n* Only policies in one direction can be created in each request.
