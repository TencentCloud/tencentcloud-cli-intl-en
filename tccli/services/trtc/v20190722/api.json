You can use this API to record the streams in a room separately, or you can mix the streams first and then record the mixed stream.\n\n### You can use this API to perform the following operations:\n* Specify the anchors whose streams you want or do not want to record by using the `RecordParams` parameter\n* Specify the storage service you want to save recording files to by using the `StorageParams` parameter\n* Specify transcoding settings for mixed-stream recording, including video resolution, video bitrate, frame rate, and audio quality, by using `MixTranscodeParams`\n* Specify the layout of different videos in mixed-stream recording mode or select an auto-arranged layout template\n\n### Key concepts\n* Single-stream recording: Record the audio and video of each subscribed user (`UserId`) in a room and save the recording files (M3U8/TS) to the cloud\n* Mixed-stream recording: Mix the audios and videos of subscribed users (`UserId`) in a room, record the mixed stream, and save the recording files (M3U8/TS) to the cloud",
