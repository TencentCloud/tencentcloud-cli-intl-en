It can be further processed (transcoded, published on WeChat, etc.).\n\nAn example is as follows: for a complete football match, the source LVB recording video may be up to 2 hours in length. You want to store this video for only 2 months for the purpose of cost savings. However, you want to specify a longer retention period for the \"highlights\" video created by live clipping and perform additional VOD operations on it such as transcoding and release on WeChat. In this case, you need to choose the persistent clipping mode of live clipping.\n\nThe advantage of persistent clipping is that the clipped video has a lifecycle independent of the source recording video and can be managed independently and stored persistently.\n\n### Temporary clipping\nIn temporary clipping mode, the clipped video (m3u8 file) shares the same ts segments with the LVB recording video instead of being an independent video. It only has a playback URL but has no `FileId`, and its validity period is the same as that of the LVB recording video; therefore, if the LVB recording video is deleted, it cannot be played back.\n\nFor temporary clipping, as the clipping result is not an independent video, it will not be included in VOD's media asset management (for example, it will not be counted in the total videos in the console), and no video processing operations can be separately performed on it, such as transcoding and release on WeChat.\n\nThe advantage of temporary clipping is that the clipping operation is very \"lightweight\" and does not incur additional storage fees.

Please use `CreateTime` instead.)\n- Specify the end (`EndTime`) of the time range to search by creation time. (This is not recommended. Please use `CreateTime` instead.)\n- You can search by any combination of the parameters above. For example, you can search for media files with the tag \"Drama\" or \"Suspense\" in the category of \"Movies\" and \"TV Series\" created between 12:00:00, December 1, 2018 and 12:00:00, December 8, 2018. Note that for parameters whose data type is array, the search logic between their elements is \"OR\". The search logic between parameters is \"AND\".\n\n- You can sort the results by creation time and return them in multiple pages by specifying `Offset` and `Limit`.\n- You can use `Filters` to specify the types of file information to return (all types are returned by default). Valid values:\n    1. `basicInfo`: The file name, category, playback URL, thumbnail, etc.\n    2. `metaData`: The file size, duration, video stream information, audio stream information, etc.\n    3. `transcodeInfo`: The URLs, video stream parameters, and audio stream parameters of transcoding outputs.\n    4. `animatedGraphicsInfo`: The information of the animated images (such as GIF images) generated.\n    5. `sampleSnapshotInfo`: The information of the sampled screenshots generated.\n    6. `imageSpriteInfo`: The information of the image sprites generated.\n    7. `snapshotByTimeOffsetInfo`: The information of the time point screenshots generated.\n    8. `keyFrameDescInfo`: The video timestamp information.\n    9. `adaptiveDynamicStreamingInfo`: The specification, encryption type, format, etc.\n\n<div id=\"maxResultsDesc\">Limits for returned records:</div>\n- The <b><a href=\"#p_offset\">Offset</a> and <a href=\"#p_limit\">Limit</a> parameters determine the number of records per page. If neither parameter is passed, this API will return up to 10 records.</b>\n- <b>Up to 5,000 records can be returned.

      "document": "This API is used to cut a clip from an HLS video to generate a new video (in HLS format). You can either share the new video or save it.\n\nVOD supports two types of clipping:\n- Clipping for persistent storage: The video clip is saved as an independent video file with its own `FileId`.\n- Clipping for temporary sharing: The video clip shares `FileId` with the input file.\n\nNotes:\n- Clipping is based on the M3U8 file that contains a list of TS segments, so the smallest clipping unit is one TS segment instead of a second or less.\n\n\n### Clipping for persistent storage\nIn this mode, a video clip is saved as an independent video file with a `FileId`, and its lifecycle is not subject to the input video. Even if the source video is deleted, the video clip still exists. Moreover, the video clip can be transcoded, published on WeChat, and processed in other ways.\n\nSuppose you recorded a two-hour football match. You want to save the full video for only two months to save costs, but want to save the highlights for a longer time and perhaps transcode and publish the highlight clip to WeChat. In this case, you can choose clipping for persistent storage.\n\nThe advantage of clipping for persistent storage is that the video clip has a lifecycle independent of the input video and can be managed independently and stored persistently.\n\n### Clipping for temporary sharing\nThe video clip (an M3U8 file) shares the same TS segments with the input video instead of being an independent video. It only has a playback URL but has no `FileId`, and its validity period is the same as that of the input video. Once the input video is deleted, the video clip cannot be played back.\n\nBecause the video clip is not an independent video, it’s not displayed as a media asset in the VOD console, and cannot be transcoded or published to WeChat.\n\nClipping for temporary sharing is lightweight and incurs no additional storage fees. However, the video clip has the same lifecycle as the source recording video and cannot be transcoded or processed in other ways.",
